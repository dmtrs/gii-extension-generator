gii-widget-generator
===================
version: 0.1
author: Dimitrios Mengidis

###Why 
I am developing a lot of extensions lately and i have found my self creating a template with common code for widget.
I have been cutting and adding thinks for diff widget ( some use jquery some not, some have css some others not ...etc ),
so with the power of gii i am able to create a much more better approach for my widget templates.

###Config
Add files under webapp/protected/gii/widget/ folder and then add
~~~
[php]
		'gii'=>array(
            ...
            'generatorPaths'=>array(
                'application.gii'
            ),
            ...
		),
~~~        
to your protected/config/main.php file
